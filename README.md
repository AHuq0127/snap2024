# Car Catalog Website

Welcome to the Car Catalog website, an interactive platform where users can browse a collection of cars categorized by type such as electric, sedan, coupe, truck, and sports cars.

## How It Works

The website showcases a variety of cars for users to explore. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:
